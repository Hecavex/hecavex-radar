            <h3>CertStream</h3>

              Emits Certificate Transparency updates over a websocket. Radar reads DNS names, rejects official domains,
              applies its public matcher, and archives qualifying candidates without retrieving those domains. The lite
              stream can add sanitized validity, issuer, fingerprint, and same-registrable certificate-name context.

            <p>
              Authenticated passive searches require public visibility in both the search summary and result detail.
              Queries cover the rolling previous seven days. Exact-domain, brand, title, and primary-document hash pivots
              remain bounded and independently validated. Accepted reports can add same-host page, network, provider-score,
              and TLS context; Radar never submits a scan or visits a candidate host.

            <p>
              An hourly bounded search rotates across reviewed brand terms and persists a numeric cursor for each query.
              It also rechecks a bounded overlap behind each cursor for late-indexed rows and resumes a declared backlog
              before normal rotation. Results are re-matched and retained in the same CT archive with explicit discovery
              lineage. Provider indexing, availability, and result limits mean this is replayable search, not complete
              global CT coverage.

              normalization, brand scope, evidence, timestamp, and size checks before it can appear publicly. An explicit
              sanitized local review candidate uses the same source label; <code>discoveredVia</code> distinguishes the two paths.

            <p>
              Each Radar row becomes one STIX <code>domain-name</code> Cyber-observable Object and one linked
              <code>observed-data</code> Domain Object. The feed intentionally contains no STIX Indicator object,
              detection pattern, malware label, threat-actor attribution, or block decision.

            <h3>Domains are refanged in STIX</h3>
            <p>
              STIX <code>domain-name.value</code> uses a normalized refanged hostname so compliant tooling can parse it.
              Treat values as untrusted observables: do not browse, resolve, scan, or block them without independent review.

              Radar source, brand, status, matching score, reason codes, and stable signal ID use namespaced custom
              properties. The matching score is not mapped to STIX confidence because it is neither a probability nor a verdict.

              not relicense source evidence. Automated candidates and inconclusive reviews never become Indicators.

            Radar is a HECAVEX-operated public research service, not a 24/7 SOC, incident-response service,
            brand-monitoring contract, notification service, takedown provider, or availability SLA.

              Automated workflows publish when their validation gates pass. Source-panel state and snapshot timestamps
              expose what the current data can establish; workflow history remains the operational source of truth.

            <p>
              Do not open a public issue for vulnerabilities, credentials, victim data, or sensitive indicators. Use the
              published security contact and avoid contacting a suspected phishing host while reproducing a problem.

            <h3>Cookieless performance measurement</h3>
            <p>
              Radar uses Cloudflare Web Analytics to measure page views and browser performance. Its beacon does not set
              or read cookies or browser storage, and the loader stops when the browser sends a Do Not Track preference.
              Radar sends no custom analytics events and does not serialize signal rows, indicator text, table searches,
              filter values, or unpublished CTI data into analytics payloads.
